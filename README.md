# Inkarto Hackathon - Automated Testing Framework

This repository contains a comprehensive automated testing framework developed for validating the functionalities of the Inkarto web application. The project is built using industry-standard practices and modern testing tools to ensure high reliability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Project Objectives

- Conduct end-to-end automated UI testing of the Inkarto website.
- Facilitate cross-browser and parallel testing using Selenium Grid.
- Implement data-driven testing for extensive input coverage.
- Generate structured logs and reports for better traceability.
- Capture failure evidence using automated screenshots.
- Provide a reusable and scalable testing architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 21 or higher
- Apache Maven 3.6 or higher
- Chrome and/or Edge browsers
- Allure Command Line Tool (for reports)
- Selenium Grid (for remote execution)

### Build and Run the Project

To clean and build the project:
```
mvn clean install
```

To execute tests using the default suite:
```
mvn test
```

To run a specific suite:
```
mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml
```

To generate and open Allure report:
```
allure serve target/allure-results
```

## Framework Features

### Page Object Model (POM)

The framework uses the Page Object Model with PageFactory to ensure separation of concerns and improve reusability and readability.

### Cross-Browser Testing

Browser support is parameterized via TestNG. The framework supports execution on both Chrome and Edge.

### Cucumber Integration

Supports BDD-style test development using Gherkin feature files and step definitions.

### Data-Driven Testing

Supports dynamic input through external data sources:
- Excel files using Apache POI
- JSON files for structured data
- `.properties` files for configuration

### Retry Mechanism

Includes a custom implementation of TestNG's `IRetryAnalyzer` to rerun failed tests and handle flaky test cases.

### Logging

Logs test execution using Log4j2 with timestamps, log levels, and error details. Logs are saved under `logs/automation.log`.

### Screenshot Capture

Automatically captures a screenshot on test failure. Files are stored under the `screenshots/` directory.

### Selenium Grid Support

Can run tests in parallel across nodes using Selenium Grid for distributed execution.

### Allure Reporting

Provides advanced test reporting using Allure, including detailed step execution and failure analysis.

## Output Locations

- Logs: `logs/automation.log`
- Screenshots: `screenshots/`
- Reports: `target/allure-results/`
